Project Highlights:
Scalability: Showcase your ability to build scalable systems using microservices and asynchronous processing.
Security: Implement secure user authentication and role-based access controls.
Data Management: Use a mix of SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases to manage data effectively.
Performance Optimization: Use Redis caching, asynchronous message queuing, and load balancing through API Gateway.
Documentation: Write comprehensive API documentation using Swagger or SpringDoc OpenAPI.
